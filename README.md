Small React app with a textbox for you to paste Japanese text into.
What's returned is a list of Kanji blobs (could be terms), ordered by frequency of appearance. 

TODO: actually show how many times each blob appears in a non-selectable way.

Idea is for only the terms be selectable to facilitate input into a glossary or another tool.
